# Rhythmos Editor - Importing AudioClips

In order to actually have sounds in our rhythms, we need to import audio clips into RhythmosDatabase.

1. Go to **AudioClips** tab

2. You have two ways to add `AudioReference`:

- Click in the bottom button with plus sign `+` and manually select the desired sound effect in AudioClip field

- Or by drag and drop `AudioClips` to Rhythmos Editor window:

  1. Select your files in Project explorer
  2. Drag to RhythmosEditor window
  3. Drop the files inside the scroll view area

  1. The `AudioReference` index
  2. Custom color. Colors serve to distinguish notes when you are editing rhythms.
  3. AudioClip field. If this field is not set and a Rhythm is using will simple not be played. Tip: select short sounds only.
  4. Remove this `AudioReference`. Be careful. Removing one item in the list can damage the rhythms
