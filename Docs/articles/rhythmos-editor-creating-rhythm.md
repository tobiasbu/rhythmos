   - (1) **Rhythm Settings**: set name and tempo of rhythm
   - (2) **Timeline**: displays player options, rhythm timeline and note creation options
   - (3) **Note configuration**: When a note is selected you can whether set a note or rest, set the beat value and the `AudioReference`.

Initially the options in the **Timeline** and **Note Settings** are unavailable because the rhythm is empty. With this overview let's continue in our composition.
