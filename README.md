## Notes

This project was created for "Games Project:  Games Engines" class in 2015 at [Unisinos](http://www.unisinos.br/global/en/). It was especially made for my game Koko-Kuba. Since the asset is totally free I decided to make the code open-source. 

> _Beware!_ The code of this project was written in less than a week and is totally a mess. 

:star: I intend to bring more one update to support Unity 2020 versions and some new features See the [roadmap](https://github.com/tobiasbu/rhythmos-engine/projects) for more information.
